# Speed Reader

Reason for creation: I had a _some_ free time and thought i would build a prototype of a speed reader.

Current Limitations: memory retention is very poor when using the program

Possible Improvements: implement mnemonic devices to improve memory retention

WARNING: this project is **very** badly designed. This is just the quickist way i could develop a working prototype
